		    <p>I have been learning Computer Science for the last 4 years. It's my second year in college learning about Computer Science. I know Python, C, C# and i'm currently learning HTML and Assembly.</p>
            <p>I completed all of the styling and coding of our navigation for our project except the navigation bar on georgia swarm, buffalo bandits and panther city pages. With style ideas from Christian I was able to make the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog page</a>. I also worked on the following pages by myself: <a href="EAST_TEAMS/EAST_TEAMS.html">East Teams</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/WEST_TEAMS.html">West Teams</a>, <a href="MORE/SCHEDULE.html">Schedule</a>, <a href="EAST_TEAMS/ALBANY_FIREWOLVES.html">Albany Firewolves</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/LASVEGAS_DESERTDOGS.html">Las Vegas Desert Dogs</a>, and <a href="EAST_TEAMS/NEWYORK_RIPTIDE.html">New York Riptide</a></p>

                I've been coding for a little over a year, exclusively in Python before this semester. 
                I've been interested in computers and how they work since I was in elementary school, so the CS track seemed like an obvious choice.

                My personal contributions to the page was the design and coding of the <a href="EAST_TEAMS/BUFFALO_BANDITS.html">Buffalo Bandits</a>,
                <a href="EAST_TEAMS/GEORGIA_SWARM.html">Georgia Swarm</a>, and the <a href="WEST_TEAMS/PANTHERCITY_LACROSSECLUB.html">Panther City LC</a> Info and Roster Pages, along with the Navbar on those pages.

            <p>This is my second semester at WMU. I transferred here from a community college with most of my WES classes being covered by transfer credits. While I have not done a ton of coding before this school year, I have tinkered with various languages like Python, Java, and Ruby before.</p>
	    <p>My contributions to the site include the <a href="EAST_TEAMS/TORONTO_ROCK.html">Toronto Rock</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/SANDIEGO_SEALS.html">San Diego Seals</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/SASKATCHEWAN_RUSH.html">Saskatchewan Rush</a>, and <a href="WEST_TEAMS/VANCOUVER_WARRIORS.html">Vancouver Warriors</a> pages.</p>

		    <p class="text-center">First year CS student</p>
            <p>As a student, I've only just started into Computer Science after leaving medicine for less patient-centered pastures. Unlike other people my age, I never used MySpace/Tumblr/Neopets, so I haven't played around with HTML before. That said I've been having a blast with it. I've started making basic web-based JS pages to streamline my fiancee's auditing work, all using what we've learned as a springboard. I'm excited to see what we learn in the second part of this semester.</p>
            <p>My personal pages are the <a href="EAST_TEAMS/HALIFAX_THUNDERBIRDS.html">Halifax</a>, <a href="EAST_TEAMS/ROCHESTER_KNIGHTHAWKS.html">Rochester</a>, <a href="MORE/HISTORY.html">History</a> and <a href="MORE/BRACKETS.html">Bracket Creator</a> pages. I made the layout and first pass for <a href="#here" id="here">the current page</a> and the same basic layout is reused for the the <a href="references.html">References page</a>. I also made a flexible and modular layout for the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog page</a>. The <a href="index.html#slideshow">slideshow</a> on the index page was also built by me using photos uploaded by the team.</p>

		    <p>This is my third semester at Western Michigan. I previously went to a community college but I didn't take any CS classes there because they wouldn't transfer but I've been enjoying taking classes that are actually in my major instead of just Gen Eds since I got to Western. I didn't do much programming before college but I do know python and a bit of C.</p>
            <p>The pages I personally worked on were the <a href="EAST_TEAMS/PHILIDELPHIA_WINGS.html">Wings</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/COLORADO_MAMMOTH.html">Mammoth</a>, <a href="WEST_TEAMS/CALGARY_ROUGHNECKS.html">Roughnecks</a>, and <a href="MORE/RULES.html">Rules</a> pages. I also made everything besides the slideshow and navigation on the <a href="index.html">index</a> page.</p>
