  <h1>Rules of Box Lacrosse</h1>

  <!--Basics-->
  <h2>The Basics</h2>
  <p>In box lacrosse each team consists of 6 players, with 5 runners and 1 goalkeeper. The main objective is to score goals by 
    getting the ball in their opponents goal while preventing the other team from scoring in their goal. Goals must be scored by 
    throwing the ball using the stick, not any body part. There are three 15 minute periods and each starts with a faceoff. 
  </p>
    
  <!--Arena-->
  <h2>Arena</h2>
  <p>Box Lacrosse is usually (but not always) played in a hockey arena covered with synthetic turf so the arena is about 180-200ft long 
    and 85 ft wide with boards and safety glass around the outside. There are team benches and penalty benches on the sides of the arena. 
    There are goals on both sides of the arena measuring 4'9" wide and 4' tall. Each goal is surrounded by a 9'3" radius crease. 
    The field is divided in two halves called the defensive and offensive halves and there is a small x or circle in the middle where 
    faceoffs occur.
  </p>

  <!--Time-->
  <h2>Time</h2>
  <p>The game is divided into three 15 minute periods with two minute breaks between them. The teams switch sides each period. 
    If both teams are tied at the end of the game it goes into overtime which means 5 minute periods continue until either side scores. 
    Each team gets two 30 second time outs per game plus one per overtime period. If a team takes possession of the ball in their 
    defensive half of the field they must get the ball to the offensive half within 10 seconds and must stay in the offensive half. 
    The team in possession of the ball must take a shot within 30 seconds or they lose possession. 
  </p>

  <!--Faceoffs-->
  <h2>Faceoffs</h2>
  <p>When a faceoff occurs one player from each team must come to the center of the field facing their opponents goal and put the 
    head of their sticks on the ground. When the referee says set they must remain motionless until the whistle is blown then they 
    can attempt to get the ball. Every other player must remain in their position until the whistle is blown and cannot interfere 
    with the faceoff until it is over.
  </p>

  <!--Teams-->
  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Each team can have up to 22 players, 20 runners and 2 goalies, but only 6 can be on the field at one time. Each team can 
    appoint captains who can discuss playing rules with the officials but cannot dispute calls by them. In-homes are runners 
    who are designated to serve penalties for goalies or for players who cannot serve their penalty for some reason. Goalies 
    have special priveleges while within the crease. They can block the ball using any part of their stick or body, throw the 
    ball, can't be checked, etc. If a goalie chooses to leave the crease they lose all these privileges. If a team has no 
    clearly designated goalie during the game then no one has goalie privileges. 
  </p>

<!--Penalties-->
  <h2>Penalties</h2>
  <p>There are five types of penalties: Technical, Minor, Major, Match and Misconduct. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For a technical penalty the punishment varies but is usually just turning over possession of the ball.</li>
    <li>For a minor penalty the player is removed from play for two minutes or until the opposing team scores a goal. Four minor 
      penalties by the same player results in removal from the rest of the game and the in-home serving their penalty in their place.</li>
    <li>For a major penalty the player is removed for five minutes. If the opposing team scores two goals a replacement player 
      can be put in but the first player must serve the full time. Two major penalties by the same player results in removal from the 
      rest of the game and the in-home serving their penalty.</li>
    <li>For a match penalty the player is immediately removed from the rest of the game and the in-home must serve their 
      five minute penalty.</li>
    <li>For a misconduct penalty the player is removed for ten minutes. Another player on the team can replace the penalized player 
      immediately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Goalies do not serve minor or major penalties but the in-home on the team serves any penalty they recieve. Also if a 
    team is down two players and another player gets a penalty, the opposing team just gets a penalty shot instead. For a penalty 
    shot a player is allowed to take a shot at the goal with no other runners on the field and only the goalie to try to block them.
