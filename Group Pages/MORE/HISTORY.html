            The National Lacrosse League (NLL) has a fascinating history that spans over three decades. Founded in 1986, the NLL was established as a professional indoor lacrosse league, with the primary goal of bringing together the best indoor lacrosse players from the United States and Canada. The league was formed by a group of owners who were looking to create a more organized and professional indoor lacrosse league, following the success of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) in the United States.

            Initially, the league was known as the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, and it consisted of just four teams: the Baltimore Thunder, the <a href="../EAST_TEAMS/PHILIDELPHIA_WINGS.html" title="Visit the Philadelphia Wings page"> Philadelphia Wings</a>, the Washington Wave, and the New Jersey Saints. However, the league struggled to gain traction in its early years, with low attendance numbers and financial instability.

          <p>
            Despite the difficulties, the NLL continued to grow, expanding to include more teams and attract a larger and more devoted fan base. The league underwent a significant change in 1998, changing its name to the National Lacrosse League. This change reflected the league's newfound status as a major professional sports league, and it helped to establish the league's identity as a top-tier indoor lacrosse competition.

          <p style="clear: right;">
            The 1990s were a turning point for the NLL, as the league began to gain more recognition and respect from the wider sporting community. One of the key drivers of this success was the league's decision to expand into Canada, with the addition of the <a href="../EAST_TEAMS/TORONTO_ROCK.html" title="Visit the Toronto Rock page">Toronto Rock</a> and the Montreal Express in 1998. These teams helped to bring in a new wave of fans, and they helped to establish the NLL as a truly international league.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2001, the NLL merged with the Major Indoor Lacrosse League, creating a united front for the sport of indoor lacrosse in North America. The merger was a significant moment in the history of the league, as it brought together some of the top teams and players from both leagues. This helped to establish the NLL as the premier indoor lacrosse league in North America and set the stage for future growth and success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the merger, the NLL has continued to expand and evolve, with more teams joining every year and a growing number of fans tuning in to watch the games. Today, the NLL consists of 15 teams from the United States and Canada, and it is widely considered to be one of the most exciting and competitive sports leagues in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout its history, the NLL has been characterized by a deep passion for the sport of indoor lacrosse and a commitment to providing fans with the best possible experience. From its humble beginnings to its current status as a major professional sports league, the NLL has been a shining example of what can be accomplished through hard work, dedication, and a love of the game.

              Lacrosse is one of the oldest team sports in North America, dating back to the 17th century when it was played by Native American tribes. Originally known as "stickball," the game involved large teams and fields, and was played with sticks and a hard ball. In the mid-19th century, Canadian dentist W. George Beers standardized the rules and equipment, leading to the development of the modern game. Today, lacrosse is played by millions of people worldwide.
